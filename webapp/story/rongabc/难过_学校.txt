Hi, Simon. I'm Coco. After school today, my friends and I played with building blocks on the playground and ate delicious food together. I sat on the soft grass, watching my blocks slowly stack up into tall buildings, feeling very satisfied.

Then, my good friend Kiki and I had an argument. We had different ideas about how to build it - I insisted on making it taller while Kiki wanted to increase the stability of the tower. Our voices grew louder, and the argument became more intense. In the end, we stopped talking friendly to each other and started blaming each other.

Later, our friends came over to us with soda and cake. They came up with a great idea suggesting that we combine both of our ideas to create a tall and stable tower. We made up with each other and started building together again. Under the sunset, we built a castle together, shared cake, drank soda - it was beautiful.
